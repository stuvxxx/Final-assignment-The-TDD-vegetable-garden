1: write one or more tests for a piece of functionality.
2: run the new tests and check that they fail (red).
3: write code to pass all tests (green).
4: improve the code so that it looks neat (refactor).
5: commit your code.
6: back to step 1 with the next piece of functionality





"crop" is a collection of plants of the same species, so for example a field of corn.
"costs" is the cost of sowing one plant.
"yield" is the yield of one plant or one crop (in kilograms).
"sale price" is the selling price of a type of fruit or vegetable per kilo.
"revenue" is the turnover or income of one kilo of fruit or vegetables.
"profits" is profit, so that is revenue - costs.
"factor" in this context is an environmental factor that influences the yield.



Cost
The costs of sowing a plant are fixed per plant.

Example: Sowing 1 maize plant costs 1 euro.

If you have a crop of 230 maize plants, the costs for that crop are therefore 230 euros.
